# üí∞ Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project implements a machine learning model to predict salaries based on various personal and professional attributes. The application is built using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for making predictions.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Interactive Web Interface:** A user-friendly Streamlit application for inputting details and getting salary predictions.

* **Random Forest Regression Model:** Utilizes a robust Random Forest Regressor for accurate salary predictions.

* **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, categorizes job titles, and encodes categorical features for model readiness.

* **Model Evaluation:** Provides key regression metrics ($R^2$, MAE, MSE, RMSE) to assess model performance.

* **Data Visualizations:** Includes insightful graphs within the Streamlit sidebar to understand salary distribution and relationships with other features.

* **Responsive UI:** Designed with Tailwind CSS for a professional, interactive, and mobile-friendly experience.

## üìä Dataset

The project uses a `Salary_Data.csv` dataset, which contains the following columns:

* **Age:** Age of the individual.

* **Gender:** Gender of the individual.

* **Education Level:** Highest education level attained.

* **Job Title:** Specific job role.

* **Years of Experience:** Total years of professional experience.

* **Salary:** The target variable to be predicted.

The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps including handling missing values, categorizing less frequent job titles into an 'Others' category, and encoding categorical features like Gender and Education Level into numerical representations.

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```

git clone [https://github.com/Yashyc27/Salary-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/Yashyc27/Salary-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning.git)
cd Salary-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

```

python -m venv venv

````

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

* **Windows:**

  ```
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

* **macOS/Linux:**

  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
Ensure you have `Salary_Data.csv` in the project root directory. Then install the required Python packages:

````

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

If you don't have `requirements.txt`, create it with the following content:

```

streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

```

And then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## üèÉ Usage

To start the Streamlit application:

```

streamlit run app.py

```

This will open the application in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`). You can then interact with the sliders and dropdowns to input details and get a predicted salary.

## üìà Model Evaluation

The Random Forest Regressor model was evaluated using the following metrics on the test set:

* **R-squared (**$R^2$**):** Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables. A higher value (closer to 1) indicates a better fit.

* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** The average of the absolute differences between predictions and actual values. Lower values indicate better accuracy.

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** The average of the squared differences between predictions and actual values. Penalizes larger errors more. Lower values indicate better accuracy.

* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The square root of the MSE, providing the error in the same units as the target variable. Lower values indicate better accuracy.

*(You would insert your actual metric values here, e.g., from the output of the evaluation code)*

```

\--- Random Forest Regression Model Metrics ---
R-squared (R2): 0.9710  \# Example value
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $2700.50 \# Example value
Mean Squared Error (MSE): $12000000.00 \# Example value
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $3464.10 \# Example value

```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application can be deployed using various methods:

* **Streamlit Community Cloud:** The easiest way to deploy directly from your GitHub repository.

* **ngrok:** For temporarily exposing your local Streamlit server to the internet for sharing or testing.

* **Other Cloud Platforms:** Can be deployed on platforms like Heroku, Google Cloud Platform (App Engine/Cloud Run), or AWS (EC2/Elastic Beanstalk) with appropriate configurations (e.g., `Dockerfile`, `Procfile`).
